### Given:
  
Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software   
engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making   
code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.  
  
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates  
its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video AND add it to the readme of your project.
  
**Note**: There is no starter code for this assignment.
     
-   The application will be invoked by using the following command:   
   
-   node index.js   
   
-   Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that   
-   demonstrates its functionality. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to   
-   record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video _and_ add it to the README of your project.

- WHEN I select the engineer option  
- THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu  
- WHEN I select the intern option  
- THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu  
- WHEN I decide to finish building my team  
- THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
