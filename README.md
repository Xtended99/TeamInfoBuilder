### Given:

-   When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README   
-   for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it,   
-   how to report issues, and how to make contributions&mdash;this last part increases the likelihood   
-   that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.   
   
-   You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.   
-   This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.   
   
-   Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md   
-   file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).   
-   Review the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)   
-   as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.   
   
-   The application will be invoked by using the following command:   
   
-   node index.js   
   
-   Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that   
-   demonstrates its functionality. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to   
-   record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video _and_ add it to the README of your project.

-   THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests   
-   WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options   
-   THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of 
-      the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under   
-   WHEN I enter my GitHub username   
-   THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile   
-   WHEN I enter my email address   
-   THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
